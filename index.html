            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>After the separation of Vietnam into two states, the north being communist and backed by their communist allies and the south being free and a non-communist state backed by France. As the US was extremely paranoid of the spread of communism in the world, 
                believing that if Vietnam “fell” and became communist, the rest of Southeast Asia would fall as well. This notion motivated the United States into deploying troops to South Vietnam to support the dictator Ngô Đình Diệm. 
                They justified their actions by claiming that they were only assisting the nations of Southeast Asia because they deserved freedom. The US would use extremely brutal strategies to win the war, such as air strikes, bombings and the use of Agent Orange, 
                but that didn’t ultimately succeed. Their actions led to countless civilian deaths in both the North and South, and a mental deterioration in their soldiers and outrage in the United States’ civilian populace. This outrage back home over the US’s actions forced the government to remove their troops from Vietnam, but the damage had been done.  </p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>In the 1970’s and 80’s, the United States had a brutal, self-centered foreign policy regarding Central America, 
                justifying their actions as preventing communism. Their support of brutal military regimes who murdered and tortured 
                their opponents led to a halt in economic development and the rise of many gangs. In both Guatemala and El Salvador, 
                the US supported a dictatorship and backed their military, and in both cases, the military regimes spread death and 
                destruction across their respective countries. The onslaught convinced many civilians to leave their homes for the US, 
                but many were deported back to their countries. In Mexico, the US signed trade agreements which would allow them to sell 
                their commerce in Mexico. The cheap manufactured products that the US sold put many Mexican Farmers out of business as 
                they couldn’t catch up, leading to an influx of migrants to urban cities to America itself. But regardless of where they go, 
                migrants are subject to poverty and violence.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p> 
                Zimbabwe was one of the most developed, vibrant, and productive countries. However, due to several political and economic crises, there has been a great breakdown in terms of standards of living, 
                infrastructure, education, and the health system. With the decline of the country, Zimbabwe is falling into a positive feedback loop as government policies harm the agriculture sector, 
                leading to poor healthcare conditions in a country infested with HIV, malaria, and other deadly diseases. The United States supports Zimbabwe in all aspects including healthcare, food security, economics, 
                and promoting domestic governance. Zimbabwe is one of the countries that the US has been supporting the longest, since its independence in 1980 up until now. 
                The USAID provides treatment and the prevention of deadly diseases while through donations and help from multiple organizations, people of Zimbabwe has received agricultural aid, improvements, 
                and connections to outside markets. Finally, through support from USAID, gender equality, youth education, and government independence are improved in all aspects. 
                There is further participation from local organizations as well in terms of improving the effectiveness of the parliament as well as disaster support from USAID themselves when faced with extreme weather conditions 
                (depicted in the map to the left). More recently, Zimbabwe recieved relief for over 100,000 of its urban dwellers during COVID-19. Overall, although the world did not uphold significant backlash towards US's actions, 
                there were still debats as Zimbabwe contained an abundance of minerals, hinting at the real motives of the US.</p>

            <p>During the late 20th century, the US was increasingly involved within the affairs of the Middle East, 
                leading many Islamic fundamentalists to take up violence in an act to defend themselves and their values in an extreme manner. 
                This led to the growth of many terrorist groups, the most notorious being the Taliban, who were involved with the bombing of the twin towers on 9/11. 
                The catastrophic event motivated the United States to declare a war on terrorism, allowing them to influence and intervene in the Middle East under an ideological cause. 
                The White House justified their motives with the notion that they were spreading freedom and liberty to all and releasing parts of the world from oppression. 
                They preemptively attacked Iraq under the cover that their leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, 
                which were never found. The US’s wrath devasted Iraq, creating many bereaved and refugee civilians and attempting to impose their own rule, creating much controversy. 
                The nation’s populace and the world as a whole thought what the US had done was inexcusable and unwarranted, 
                leading to the criticism that the republic of American had become an empire in practice.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>US’s support in Greenland consists of promoting enterprise driven, sustainable, and inclusive economical growth. 
                It is led by the USAID organization. The helping hand from USAID was very recent, with its support only dating back to 2022. 
                Greenland is a rather isolated country with an extremely sparse population (See map to the left), its potential for economic diversity and growth is limited. 
                The US is working with Greenland to increase opportunities for inclusive economical participation through Greenland-owned solutions. Specifically, 
                the US identifies 3 priorities in aiding Greenland: Energizing Greenland’s entrepreneurial system, advancing Greenland’s market diversification efforts, 
                and unlocking Greenland’s green growth potential. In terms of increasing trade, 
                the US will be incorporating Greenland into its own markets in cooperation with a broad set of Greenlandic private sector and government stakeholders. 
                The US is also continually encouraging entrepreneurship in order to improve the economic growth by fostering a community of future entrepreneurs. 
                All in all, the support of US is not immediate but is crucial to maintaining and improving the state of Greenland.  </p>

            <h2>Essential Question - Andy's Perspective</h2>
            <p>
                The appropriate role of the United States in world affairs, considering both past and present events, involves many factors. 
                Although not always resulting in positive outcomes, nor were all of them even beneficial to the US, 
                I believe that the US was extremely strategic and diplomatic in its involvement in world affairs. 
                The role of the US can be seen as an imperialistic country that provides support for those in need while expanding its own political
                 and economic power. For example, in both cases of its involvement in Vietnam and Central America, the intentions that the 
                 US presented to the world were overwhelmingly positive, such as helping its neighbors in Central America and preventing the spread 
                 of Communism in Southeast Asia. However, its hidden motives were to gain political control and prevent the influence of communism in 
                 halting international trade relations. Although the world was quick to realize the underlying motives of the US and threw significant 
                 backlash towards the brutal and inhumane actions that the US forced upon its own soldiers and the people of said countries, 
                 the strategic scheme of the US's involvement in world affairs can be seen as somewhat imperialistic. Fast forward to decades later, 
                 in recent years, the US is much less extreme in satisfying its own economic and political needs, partially driven by the backlash of 
                 citizens over its past actions such as the Vietnam War. For instance, the support from the US in aiding Zimbabwe since the 1980s shows 
                 a great deal of dedication and kindness in sharing its resources and power to help those who are less fortunate. 
                 This assistance looks like a positive change compared to the US's past actions. However, there are still signs of the US's imperialistic 
                 goals in these modern efforts, even though they seem more appealing to the world than past actions. Zimbabwe is rich in natural resources 
                 and is an important partner for trade and connections to the African continent for the US. So, while the US appears to be helping, 
                 it also benefits from access to Zimbabwe’s resources and its strategic position in Africa. Overall, the US is continually aiding and spreading livelihood as opposed 
                 to its ill-intended actions of the past. However, even in modern times, the imperialistic nature of the United States still remains, 
                 and it's sometimes necessary for a country like the United States to maintain its economy and actively make their own country better.
            </p>
            <p>
                War, when waged against another country, is rarely justifiable unless it's for the purpose of self-defense. 
                The Revolutionary War can be justified due to the nature of the situation, how the colonists were being treated unfairly 
                for more than a century, and waging war was a self-defense mechanism in order to preserve people's fundamental human rights. 
                However, the recent wars that the US has waged, supported, or even participated in, can hardly be justifiable. 
                Their role in the Philippine-American War and the Vietnam War are perfect examples. The decision to participate 
                in these wars was largely motivated by economic and political needs. On one hand, this can be justified from the perspective 
                of prospering the United States, which, although not necessarily the "right" thing to do, makes sense as a political decision. 
                However, the horrifying deaths and slaughtering that the US engaged in, not only for the innocent people at the place of the war 
                but also for their own soldiers, is in no way justifiable. I believe that economic and political advantages can be negotiated and 
                traded, such as the US aiding Zimbabwe possibly in hopes of 
                gaining some of its natural resources. War, for the sole selfish purpose of economic and political prosperity, is never justifiable.

            <h2>Essential Question - Soham's Perspective</h2>
            <p>The United States is the most powerful nation on this planet, at least in terms of military strength and output, which places on its shoulders a unique role in world affairs. To some extent, the US’s involvement in foreign affairs can be a very positive thing, but its immense power and conflicting inner politics and desires are bound to harm the rest of the world if the nation’s power goes unchecked. The US may claim to have the best interest of others at heart, and in many cases it does such providing aid to unfortunate countries like Zimbabwe. However, the past has shown that the US can commit actions based on its own greed, such as its intervention in the Middle East. The 9/11 attacks were a tremendous calamity but that did not give the US a moral right to preemptively attack Iraq under faulty evidence, turning many civilians into refugees and bereaved mourners. Their actions caused untold harm, and the economic interest of oil is clearly undernoted in the nation’s involvement. In short, the United States is capable of spread aid and prosperity across the world, but it needs to remember the principles of liberty and freedom that it was built upon when committing to its actions. </p>
            <p>War, the acting of waging battle upon another, is justifiable and can be moral, but only in certain contexts. The United States’ conception is an evident example of this, the colonists in America were being treated derogatorily by their British rulers, and they engaged in Revolutionary war for their rights and the right to freedom and liberty. Very few have complaints against this, but that type of war is not the only kind. Wars can easily be fought for the personal and greedy interests of governments seeking land and wealth, or even ideologies. The US’s own battles attest to this, their role in the Vietnam War to violently stop the spread of communism was largely motivated by their economic philosophies and desires. With that justification, the nation wreaked havoc in Vietnam, literally destroying the country’s landscape with Agent Orange and ending countless lives through volatile air strikes and bombings, all for the sake of that ideology. War can be justified, but too often it is not, and any justification does not prevent the deaths of those who participate.</p>
